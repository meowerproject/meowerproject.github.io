<br><br>
The Re-Shop Channel brings back the Wii Shop Channel, and
<br>
allows downloads and uploads.
<br><br>
Uploads? What I mean by uploads is uploading Homebrew<br>
software to the Re-Shop Channel, which is a new feature<br>
The Homebrew section allows free downloads for new channels<br>
for Wii.<br>
To upload, it may take 1 day - 5 days to unpack, pack, then<br>
upload to the Re-Shop Channel.<br><br>
Downloads? Yes, you will be able to download your favorite<br>
Virtual Console titles, WiiWare titles, and channels<br><br>
Channels? Yes, courtesy of RiiConnect24, you be able to<br>
download patches for the Forecast Channel and News Channel<br>
and patched channels, such as the Check Mii Out Channel/Mii<br>
Contest Channel, Everbody Votes Channel, and Nintendo Channel.<br><br>
What about the other channels? Other channels supported by<br>
RiiConnect24 will also be available on the Re-Shop Channel.<br><br>
When will this be available? Currently, I have not created the<br>
Re-Shop Channel mains, but when I do it will be available here<br><br>

<BR><BR>
A concept I have is for a whole new UI rather than the original<br>
however I think that it would be better to keep the original,<br>
just for the sake of nostalgia.<br><br>
For a logo for the Re-Shop Channel, I was thinking of this:
<br><img src="http://u.cubeupload.com/zedthehedgehog/WiiShopChannel43.png"></img>
There is not much change here, except the bag colors are<br>
teal shades rather than blue shades.
<br><br>
I have no idea how I'm going to implement Wii Points, however<br>
when it gets released, people will only be able to use their<br>
Wii Points, until I can implement them into Re-Shop.
